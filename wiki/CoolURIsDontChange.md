# #CoolURIsDontChange

Cool #URI-s donâ€™t change, as #TimBernersLee [wrote in 1998](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html).

For #HashtagWiki this currently means that even after #refactor-ing a #hashtag, the file names will remain constant. We might need to hide the file names a bit more even in the #UserInterface.
