# #Laika

[Laika](https://planet42.github.io/Laika/) is a “site and e-book generator and customizable text markup transformer for sbt, #Scala, and #ScalaJs”.

It is a library, not a tool in itself. It looks very flexible – see its [Design Goals](https://planet42.github.io/Laika/0.17/01-about-laika/02-design-goals.html).

It does not specialize in #wiki-s but may be useful for building them.
