# #KnowledgeCrunching

Exploring a knowledge domain incrementally by interacting with #DomainModel-s.

Concept from the #DomainDrivenDesign book, see [Chaper 1: Crunching knowledge](https://www.dddcommunity.org/wp-content/uploads/files/books/chapter01.pdf).

Can be done for example using #LivingDocumentation, #DeepModeling.
