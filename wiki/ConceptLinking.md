# #ConceptLinking

Maintaining inline hyperlinks to concepts. Can be done manually (e.g. using #hashtag-s) or automatically (e.g. using #NaturalLanguageProcessing).

Related to #DenotationalSemantics, #SpacedRepetition, #folksonomy.

#OpenQuestion any good guidance of how to determine what concepts to link, how to name the concept, etc.?

## Example implementation

> Concept linking, or linking spans of text to concepts in a knowledge graph (KG), is
> an important first step in tapping into the wealth of information stored within KGs.
> Use of terminologies and vocabularies is especially prominent in the biomedical
> domain, where significant engineering effort has been made to ensure that rich
> KGs with standardized vocabularies are available.
