> Useful models seldom lie on the surface. As we come to understand the domain and the needs of the application, we usually discard su- perficial model elements that seemed important in the beginning, or we shift their perspective. Subtle abstractions emerge that would not have occurred to us at the outset but that pierce to the heart of the matter.
