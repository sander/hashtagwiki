# #HashtagWiki

A project to create a lightweight #wiki engine that:

- uses #Markdown for markup
- uses #hashtag-s for #ConceptLinking, resulting in “natural #BiDirectionalLink-s”
- enables following links using #InfoCard-s
- supports tweet block links (work in progress, see #KnowledgeCrunchingInCode)

The #hashtag-in-#Markdown syntax and inline tweets are inspired by the [SemanticBeeng/DataFabric Gist](https://gist.github.com/SemanticBeeng/2edad7a5e2cd7cd6af5cde824b4e0da0).

Sander manages the project publicly on [GitHub: sander/hashtagwiki](https://github.com/sander/hashtagwiki). Check out the `wiki` directory for human-editable source files. If you are looking at a published #HTML version, it is probably generated using GitHub Actions.
