# #LivingDocumentation

The #book [Living Documentation: Continuous Knowledge Sharing by Design](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34927405-living-documentation) introduces #DomainDrivenDesign-inspired tools and methods to build high-quality documentation throughout the #SoftwareDevelopmentLifecycle.

It features examples of #KnowledgeExtraction, #KnowledgeAugmentation, #KnowledgeCuration, automated creation of evolving documentation and diagrams, using #IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironment-s for #refactor-ing knowledge, and improving #SoftwareDesign.

The approach deals both with new and legacy environments.
